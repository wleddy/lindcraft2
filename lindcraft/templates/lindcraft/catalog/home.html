		<h2>WIDE BIKE CHANNEL FOR L-7 &amp; L-8 SLOPING RACKS</h2>
		<div style="float:left;width:300px;margin-left:10px;">
			<img style="width:290px;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/L7_2016ChanelCompare.jpg') }}" alt="Wide Channel Comparison" />
		</div>
		<p>
			The Lindcraft Wide Bike Channel was designed to accommodate plus-size tires up to 3.25" wide, 
			while still maintaining compatibility with road and mountain bike tires. The Wide Bike Channel 
			offers the greatest flexibility on a Lindcraft rack by allowing road, mountain, and plus-size 
			bikes to be displayed interchangeably.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wide Bike Channels are available as a $10 per bike upgrade when ordering new L-7 &amp; L-8 Sloping Racks. 
			The Wide Bike Channels can be purchased individually for $58 each and installed in older Sloping Racks as well.
			(Upgrade channels include larger wheel hook)
		</p>
		<p>
			Classic Bike Channels are recommended for displaying road and traditional mountain bikes only.

	<h2>Why Lindcraft Racks Are Better</h2>
	<p >
		Lindcraft racks are angled 30 degrees to the right for maximum visibility.
		This allows the handlebars to overlap without touching. We use quality anodized 
		aluminum extrusions whenever possible and powder coat all steel components. 
		Lindcraft racks are a neutral dark bronze color so as not to detract from the 
		bicycles they display. Our floor racks are black. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We offer several styles, and custom sizes are available. If you have a special
		requirement or a question, we'll be happy to give you a <a href="{{ url_for( 'www.contact') }}" >special quote</a>. 
		If you'd prefer, send an email from our <a href="{{ url_for( 'www.contact') }}">Contact Form</a>
